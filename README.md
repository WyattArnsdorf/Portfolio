# Portfolio
Showcase of some of my academic and professional work. 

All code files are exampled representations of actual live code between my course work and industry code.

# Academic
All the academic code files so far is a version of a mostly developed database and front end for CS340 Introduction to Databases. It is currently still under developement
but its latest version has all the UI pages built with most CRUD functionaltiy to them. As well it uses Node.js route handlers to handle all queries ran on a hosted
database. 

# Industry Profession
All the professional code files are examples of real world code I have developed to push changes to a live ISP network. 
All critical details have been scrubbed and data files omitted for clear security violations, but the code itself is sufficiently representative of what was written. 
The "fix_ssh_to_4300s" folder was a project developed to role out configuration changes to a networks access/aggregation switches in order to update their firewall policies. 
The "prtg" folder includes a .py file that was developed to find, organize and clean a list of object sensor names on our SNMP server and then push the changes to the 
server via its API. Lastly, the "personalModules" folder contains files with my own personally developed functions that can be reused, with the goal of trying increase my code 
reusability.
